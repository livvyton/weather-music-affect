# European climate effect on weather
## A daily top 200 Spotify Analysis 2019


## Overview

* The question I wanted to answer is if climate has an effect on peoples music choice. Please find the following two hypothesis for this analysis. 

* h0 : Weather has no effect on music choice 
* h1 : Weather has an effect on music choice 
* I will test this hypothesis by using the top 200 daily Spotify charts and world weather API to see if there is a link between the climates and music choice. 

## Data Preparation

### Overview:

* What is your dataset about?
- the dataset consists of the top 200 daily charts for each European Country 
* Where/how did you obtain your dataset?
	* Webscraper for Spotify csvs
	* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
    * [World weather API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/)
* The dataset includes 1425909 rows Ã— 24 columns.
* THE columns include: 'artist', 'position', 'streams', 'track' ,name', 'acousticness', 'cloud', 'danceability', 'date', 'energy', 'humidity','instrumentalness', 'key', 'liveness', 'loudness', 'rain', 'region','snow', 'speechiness', 'spotify_id', 'temp', 'tempo', 'valence','explicit', 'month'
.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning

* Check dtypes
* Create for loop to cast data into the right types
* Check for NaNs
* Check for duplicates
* Rename the regions to use for mapping
* Drop irrelevant columns
* Make a weighted average for the different song anaylsis features so that all the countries have relative 
* Rearrange columns for congruiety


### Data Exploration and Visualization

* I categorised the countries based on a temperature weighted mean and put them into three categories. Northern Europe for cooler climates, mid Europe for mild climates and Southern Europe for warmer climates.
* Compared the different climate categories according to different song characteristics for example, Valence, tempo, danceabiliy, energy, liveness, explit songs
* Choose to do a deeper exploration into Valence which describes the musical positiveness of the track. 
* Explored whether seasonality had an impact of Valence in Europe
* Looked at the amount of explicit songs per month
* Investigated a dip of explicit songs by a third on 24th and 25th of December




### Conclusion

* Northern Europe tend to play sad, quiet, downtempo music
* Southern Europe tend to play happy, danceable, energetic music 
* The largest disparaty between countries and climates is in winter where we can draw the most results
* In summer alot of countries around Europe are listening to the same music in the charts so there is not as much difference in results
* Europeans tend to listen to explicit music in the winter months with the exception of the 24th and 25th of December where the listeners of Explict music drops by 66%
* On the 28th Explicit music listeners increase to 150% 


### Continuation of project/Considerations 

* Compare 2019s results to 2018 to see if the same trends are visual
* Spotifys top 200 is biased in terms of streaming popular music so this could have a large effect on results
* Hard to get concrete results in terms of cause and effect because there are so many different factors ( supply/demand,seasonality)
* Is there another feature we could use in the analysis to concretely see the effect of music choice from weather
