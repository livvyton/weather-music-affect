Include the following points in your overview:

* The question I wanted to answer is if climate has an effect on peoples music choice. Please find the following two hypothesis for this analysis. 

* h_0 : Weather has no effect on music choice 
* h_1 : Weather has an effect on music choice

* I will test this hypothesis by using the top 200 daily Spotify charts and world weather API to see if there is a link between the climates and music choice.

## Conclusion

* Northern Europe tend to play sad, quiet, downtempo music
* Southern Europe tend to play happy, danceable, energetic music 
* The largest disparaty between countries and climates is in winter where we can draw the most results
* In summer alot of countries around Europe is listening to the same music in the charts so there is not as much difference in results
